        <p class="lead mb-4"> As a first generation college student, I have always been wanting to help out the youth in whatever way possible. I was president of a club in high school called Friday Night Live, it was a club about drug prevention for our youth on campus. In the duration of the club I organized events with peers in hopes that the youth would be informed about drug awareness. This club later gained attraction. Thanks to efforts alongside peers and mentors, we were able to create a course that taught others about peer mentorship at our high school. 
 <br><br>

        Before being accepted into University of California, Riverside, at Riverside City College I took various courses about childhood development. During one of the courses I learned about the development of the childhood brain. This discovery was what motivated me to apply to UCR as an Education, Society, and Human development major. As I major in this, I hope to create a unique experience for students that will ultimately help their development later in life. 
<br><br>

        One of the important roles that I’ve gotten to experience is my current position as a Customer Service Associate at Walgreens, Throughout this I’ve gained multiple skills that will help me in the field of education. One of them being the importance of leadership alongside communication. I have learned to appropriately communicate with my team members to make sure that we meet the company goals and standards. When training my fellow coworkers, I have learned that patience is key to effectiveness in the environment. I know that I definitely have my errors when it comes to training but the overall goal has always been trying to make sure the other person is doing their job. At times I try to keep up and check up on my coworkers and see how they are doing, including times when we have difficult circumstances with customers.  matter the situations with difficult customers I have also been able to manage difficult situations. I bring tranquility to the environment and this has led to customer satisfaction. At the end of the day, people can just be having a bad day and they need that person to relieve their anger or stress. I believe that Customer Service is also about being able to navigate various parts of the role, including time management. I have been able to manage tasks while at the same time taking care of stocking the shelves, taking calls on the floor, or working at the photo center.
